# Solution explanation 

I strongly belived in Divide and Conquer algorithm, one of the basic approach to solve problems using recursion. 
The mainly idea behind this algo is divide problem into smaller problems to solve bigger ones. I divided problem into:
* created Elevator class, which simulate elevator behaviour. It's undoubtedly important to focuse only on elevator and don't 
think about service. To make sure that I correctly finished this task I createe unit test to deeply test class.
* created data base, which store data about elevator instances with some basic method like findById, addElement or showAllData. In this step, 
I considered only data base and I didn't think about service. Some unit test made way test the class.
* the finally step was created service class. Below I'm showing my approach to create this class, because it have a huge impact how other 
classes should look like.
